    <h3><b>7.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</b></h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3><b>8.What is the use of the background-position property?</b></h3>
    <p>Controlling the repetition of a background image in CSS can be done using the background-repeat property.<br> This property allows you to specify whether and how the background image should repeat in both the horizontal and vertical directions.<br> There are several values you can use for background-repeat:<br>
    <b> repeat:</b>This is the default value. It repeats the background image both horizontally and vertically.<br> the image is smaller than the element it's applied to, it will repeat to fill the entire element.</p>
    <p>1.repeat-x: This value repeats the background image only horizontally, creating a horizontal stripe effect.</p>
    <p>2.repeat-y: This value repeats the background image only vertically, creating a vertical stripe effect.</p>
    <p>3.no-repeat: This value prevents the background image from repeating in either direction, so it will only appear once.</p>
    <p>4.space: This value repeats the background image both horizontally and vertically, but it adjusts the spacing between the repeated images so that they fill the container without cropping.</p>
    <p> 5.round: Similar to space, this value repeats the background image both horizontally and vertically, but it also scales the image up or down to ensure it fits the container without cropping.</p>
    <h3><b>9.What is the use of the background-position property?</b></h3>

    <h3><b>10.Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</b></h3>
    <p>The "background-attachment" property can take one of the following values:<br><b>scroll:</b> This is the default value. It allows the background image to scroll along with the content as the user scrolls down the page.<br>
    <b>fixed:</b> value makes the background image stay fixed in place relative to the viewport. As the user scrolls, the background image does not move, creating a "fixed" background effect.</p>
