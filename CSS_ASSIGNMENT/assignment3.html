    <p><b>Properties: </b>These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color .<br>
       <b>Values:</b>Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.
        </p>
    <h3><b>5.What do you understand by CSS opacity?</b></h3>
    <p>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. <br>Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, <br>and is the opposite of transparency</p>
    <h3><b>6.How can the background color of an element be changed?</b></h3>
    <p>The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an element. <br>We can set background color by selecting the element by its class name of id name and then apply the background-color property on it to set the background color.</p>
    <h3><b>7.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</b></h3>
    <p>using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</p>
    <h3><b>8. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</b></h3>
    <p>using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically.
    Controlling the repetition of a background image in CSS can be done using the background-repeat property.<br> This property allows you to specify whether and how the background image should repeat in both the horizontal and vertical directions.<br>
    <h3><b>9.What is the use of the background-position property?</b></h3>
    <p>The background-position property in CSS is used to specify the starting position of a background image <br>within its containing element. It determines where the top left corner of the background image <br>should be placed relative to the top left corner of the element. This property allows you to control<br> how the background image is positioned and displayed.</p>
    <h3><b>10.Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</b></h3>
    <p>The "background-attachment" property can take one of the following values:<br><b>scroll:</b> This is the default value. It allows the background image to scroll along with the content as the user scrolls down the page.<br>
    <b>fixed:</b> value makes the background image stay fixed in place relative to the viewport. As the user scrolls, the background image does not move, creating a "fixed" background effect.</p>
    <h3><b>11.Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</b></h3>
    <p>
      <b>Accessibility: </b> separating background and text color, you can ensure that your content is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with visual impairments. This is a fundamental principle of web accessibility.<br>
      <b>Design Flexibility: </b> background and text color allows for greater design flexibility. You can easily change the background color or image without affecting the text color, and vice versa. This makes it easier to experiment with different design choices.<br>
     <b>Readability:</b> Combining background and text color can make the content less readable. For example, using a light text color on a light background or a dark text color on a dark background can strain users' eyes and decrease readability.<br>
     <b> Responsive Design:</b> In responsive web design, the layout and design of a website may change based on the user's device and screen size. Separating background and text color helps maintain consistency and adaptability in different layouts.<br>
     <b>Print Styles:</b> When preparing a website for print, having separate properties for text and background colors allows you to create styles optimized for print, which often differ from web styles.<br>
    <b> Consistency: </b> these properties helps maintain consistency across your website. You can define a consistent text color for all elements, making it easier to manage and achieve a cohesive design.<br>
     <b>Maintenance:</b> When background and text color are separate, it's easier to maintain and update your website. If you decide to change the background color or text color, you only need to modify one property, rather than revisiting all elements that combine both properties.

    <h3><b>12.How to center block elements using CSS1?</b></h3>
    <p>In CSS1, there was no direct method for centering block elements both horizontally and vertically, as modern CSS provides. However, you could use some HTML and CSS tricks to achieve basic centering. Note that CSS1 is very limited compared to modern CSS, so these methods may not be as flexible or reliable as what's available in later versions of CSS.<br>
       <b>Centering Horizontally:</b>To center a block element horizontally within its containing element, you can set its left and right margins to "auto." <br>
       <b>Centering Vertically:</b>In CSS1, vertically centering block elements was more challenging and often required you to know the height of the container and the centered element

     <h3>13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?<br></h3>
     <p>
       <b>1 .Inline </b>- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.<br>
       <b> 2. Internal </b>- by using a style element in the head section.<br>
       <b>3. External</b> - by using a linke lement to link to an external CSS file.</p>
    <h3>14. What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
    <p>Embedded stylesheets, also known as embedded CSS,are a way to define and apply styling rules directly within <br>an HTML document. CSS is used for controlling the visual presentation of web pages, such as the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements. <br>There are three main methods for including CSS in an HTML document: inline styles, embedded styles, and external styles.</p>
    <h3>15. What are the external style sheets?</h3>
    <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.</p>
    <h3>16.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>
    <p> 1. <b>Consistency:</b> External style sheets allow you to maintain a consistent look and feel across your entire website.<br> By defining styles in one central location, you can ensure that all your web pages have a uniform appearance.<br><br>

       2.<b> Ease of Maintenance:</b> Making changes to your website's design becomes easier with external style sheets. <br>You can update the style sheet once, and the changes will automatically apply to all pages that link to it. This saves time and reduces the risk of errors.<br><br>
        
       3.<b>Faster Loading Times: </b>External style sheets are cached by the browser after the initial download. <br>This means that subsequent pages will load faster because they don't need to download the same styles again. This can improve the overall performance of your website.<br><br>
       <b>Disadvantages of External CSS:</b>
       Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.<br>
       Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site's download time.
